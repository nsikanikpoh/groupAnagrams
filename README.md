# groupAnagrams
my solution to groupAnagrams algorithm description.
In this post you would lean how to efficiently apply move semantics as it relates to c++ 11 and beyond to save memory, use of HashTable for fast and effiecient lookup and loot more.

include the following:

```bash
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
```

* Angular version : 
```bash
angular 5.0.0
```

* Cordova version : 
```bash
cordova 7.0.0
